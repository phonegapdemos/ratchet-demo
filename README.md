Ratchet is a rewritten Twitter Bootstrap framework, promised to be faster, nearly as beautiful as TB, doesn't have sidebar component, but demo shows how to implement it, easy for building many-file-based apps with cool transitions between pages.

Worht mentioning, that both @fat and @mdo, guys behind Twitter Bootstrap, are among authors or supporters of Ratchet.
