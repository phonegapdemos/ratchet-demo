## About framework

Ratchet is a rewritten Twitter Bootstrap framework, promised to be faster, nearly as beautiful as TB, doesn't have sidebar component, but demo shows how to implement it, easy for building many-file-based apps with cool transitions between pages.

## Important notices

This project can be tested directly in browser with using [Ripple Emulator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ripple-emulator-beta/geelfhphabnejjhdalkjhgipohgpdnoc?hl=en). However, project itself is written using [newest PhoneGap API](http://docs.phonegap.com/en), while Ripple Emulator has very old [2.0.0 API](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.0.0/index.html) behind. Thus, _some parts of this demo will not work in desktop computer browser_. You have to compile it and test it on mobile device, if you want to see all implemented things in action.
