# PhoneGap + Ratchet Demo

Test mobile application built with PhoneGap and Ratchet framework.

- homepage: http://www.goratchet.com/
- live demos: http://www.goratchet.com/examples/
- components: http://www.goratchet.com/one.html

Ratchet is a rewritten Twitter Bootstrap framework, promised to be faster, nearly as beautiful as TB, doesn't have sidebar component, but demo shows how to implement it, easy for building many-file-based apps with cool transitions between pages.

Worth mentioning, that both guys behind Twitter Bootstrap ([_fat_](https://twitter.com/fat) and [_mdo_](https://twitter.com/mdo)) are among authors or supporters of Ratchet.

This demo should present all key features of Ratchet framework, including all available widgets and page themes. Plus it should also contain examples of translation library for multi-language mobile apps and other libraries useful in modern mobile apps development like [meSpeak.js](http://www.masswerk.at/mespeak/) and others.
